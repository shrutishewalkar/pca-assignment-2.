    "Ans: In linear algebra, a projection is a transformation that maps a vector onto a subspace by dropping the components of the vector that lie outside the subspace. The resulting vector is called the projection of the original vector onto the subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PCA, the projection is used to project the original data onto a lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the principal components. This projection allows us to represent the data in a more compact form, while preserving the most important information. The projection is performed by multiplying the original data by the transpose of the matrix of principal components, which results in a new dataset with fewer columns (i.e., dimensions) but with similar characteristics to the original data. The resulting dataset can then be used for further analysis or visualization."
